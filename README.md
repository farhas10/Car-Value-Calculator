# Car-Value-Calculator
Using a Struct, we define a car by the following:

    Make
    Model
    Year
    Current Price

The user is asked for all of these inputs. Following the creation of this car object, the user is asked for what period of time they want to calculate depreciation. This amount is inputted into a decay function which tells the user the estimated value of the vehicle in the number of years.
